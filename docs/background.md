# Background

## Provincial Climate Data Set (PCDS)

The Provincial Climate Data Set (PCDS), is a collaboration between the BC Government's
[Climate Related Monitoring Program (CRMP)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/research-monitoring-reporting/monitoring/climate-related-monitoring)
and the
[Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC)](http://www.pacificclimate.org/).

PCDS is an archive of meteorological observations for BC collected by federal agencies,
BC ministries and crown corporations and dating back to the late 1800's. The archive consists of a relational database
that models the data collected by multiple agencies (each of which are represented by one or more "networks" in the
database) at multiple locations (represented by "stations").

## Climate Related Monitoring Program (CRMP)

The [Climate Related Monitoring Program (CRMP)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/research-monitoring-reporting/monitoring/climate-related-monitoring)
is a collaborative effort between several BC ministries, crown corporations, and PCIC.
Its purpose is to opportunistically leverage weather observations that are being collected for operational uses and
utilize them for long-term climate monitoring.
